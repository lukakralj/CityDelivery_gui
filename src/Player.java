/**
 * This class is part of CityDelivery application.
 * CityDelivery is a text based game. The aim is to complete three deliveries.
 *
 * This class controls the behaviour of a player which could be seen as an extension to
 * the class Characters. It uses a field "chr" of type Characters to communicate to the
 * map.
 *
 * When we create an object of this class two other characters (that move on their own)
 * are created. The random movement of these two characters is controlled in this class
 * because it depends on the number of moves a player makes. However, moves are then
 * executed in the class Characters.
